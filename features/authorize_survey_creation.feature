Feature: Authorizing form creation

As an admin, 
So that non-instructors can't create course surveys
I want to be able to add list of authorized instructors who can create and publish forms

#Scenario:
#Given I am an admin
#Then I should see the "Add and Instructor" button

#Scenario:
#Given I am a student
#And I go to "Make a new form"
#Then I should not be on the new/edit survey page
#And I should see an error message

#Scenario:
#Given I am an instructor
#And I do not have permission to create forms
#And I go to "Make a new form"
#Then I should not be on the new/edit survey page
#And I should see an error message

#Scenario:
#Given I am an instructor
#And I have permission to create forms
#And I go to "Make a new form"
